# Alithea Transcriptome Quantification Pipeline

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This Nextflow pipeline is designed to automate **transcript quantification** using **Kallisto** and **differential 
expression analysis** using **Sleuth**. The goal is to analyze RNA-seq references efficiently, compare **single-end vs.
paired-end pseudo-alignment results**, and streamline the process for large-scale transcriptomic studies.

The pipeline follows a **modular, scalable, and reproducible** structure, making it adaptable for different 
datasets, workflows, and potential **CI/CD integration**. While CI/CD is not required for this test, the structure 
ensures that future expansions can easily incorporate automated testing and deployment.

Each **module** is structured in a way that it could be independently hosted in a GitLab repository, enabling 
separate development, testing, and validation if needed. This is why each module includes `test_input.json`, 
stubbing, and MD5 validationâ€”ensuring that components can be tested in isolation and seamlessly integrated into
the full pipeline when required.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- **Automated transcript quantification** using **Kallisto**.
- **Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)** using **Sleuth**.
- **Support for single-end and paired-end RNA-seq analysis**.
- **Fully modular Nextflow design**, allowing independent execution of components.
- **JSON-driven execution**, enabling flexible configuration.
- **Separate testing framework** for validation and reproducibility.
- **Scalable architecture**, suitable for large datasets and potential CI/CD workflows.

## ðŸ”¹ Why This Structure?
This structure was chosen to maximize **scalability, reproducibility, and flexibility**:

- **Modular design** â†’ Each step (Kallisto, DEA, Reporting) is independently executable, making it easy to modify and scale.  
- **Reproducibility** â†’ JSON-based execution allows parameterized runs with full traceability.  
- **Independent testing** â†’ Each module and subworkflow can be tested separately using pre-defined test input JSONs.  
- **CI/CD Compatibility** â†’ Although this test project does not include CI/CD integration, the structure is **ready for GitLab CI/CD pipelines**, making it suitable for production environments.  
- **GitLab Repo Integration** â†’ Each module could be **independently hosted** in a GitLab repository and later integrated into the full pipeline seamlessly.  
- **Future-proofing** â†’ Additional steps (e.g., new statistical models, quality control, or reporting enhancements) can be easily integrated without breaking the workflow.
